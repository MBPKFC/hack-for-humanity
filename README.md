SmartScreen, is a solution designed to connect individuals with cancer pre-screening resources, ultimately increasing the number of people who get screened early for better treatment outcomes.

**The Problem**

People lack education and awareness of screening for cancer. Our target audience is the 17.6% that do not get their yearly visits and therefore will not find out what cancer screening they are due for.

**The Solution**

SmartScreen, is a solution to bridge this gap and ensure individuals feel confident and comfortable in taking these essential steps towards better health.

**SmartScreen Features**

- An Engaging and Informative Approach
- A Gamified Experience
- Locator
- Incentives
- Friendly Guidance

**Benefits**

Increased awareness and education about pre-screening
As for the American Cancer Society: Tracking users who found a primary care physician (PCP) through our app. This data supports the ACS in promoting better healthcare.

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

In order to use ScreenSmart navigate to the website at [hack-for-humanity.vercel.app/](https://hack-for-humanity.vercel.app/). Once on the webpage if you click on `Play` you will begin the game. Answer the questions to the best of your ability, the point of the game is less about being correct and more about learning the correct answer once you've answered. 

After completing the game portion you will be brought to some consumer data in order for the site to supply you with the best information possible. Once all info has been taken the site will provide you with PCP's (Primary Care Physicians) in your area that you can follow up with for a screening.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
